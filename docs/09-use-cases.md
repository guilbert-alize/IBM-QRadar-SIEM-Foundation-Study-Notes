# QRadar Use Cases

## Overview
This chapter summarizes the **QRadar Use Cases** course from the IBM QRadar SIEM Foundation learning path. It outlines practical applications of IBM QRadar SIEM in cybersecurity. I used **Grok**, created by xAI, to refine my notes for clarity and accuracy.

## Use Cases
QRadar supports a range of security scenarios:
- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Correlates events and flows to identify sophisticated attacks.
- **Insider Threat Detection**: Uses User Behavior Analytics (UBA) to detect anomalous user behavior.
- **Risk and Vulnerability Management**: Integrates with scanners and IBM BigFix for remediation.
- **Compliance and GDPR**: Generates reports to meet regulatory requirements.
- **Cloud Security**: Monitors cloud environments (e.g., AWS, Azure) via CloudTrail or VPC Flow Logs.
- **Incident Response**: Provides forensic tools and SOAR capabilities for rapid response.

## Key Takeaways
QRadarâ€™s versatility supports diverse security needs, from threat detection to compliance, in on-premises and cloud environments.
