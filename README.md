# IBM QRadar SIEM Foundation Study Notes

## Overview
This repository contains my study notes for the **IBM QRadar SIEM Foundation certification** from the IBM Security Learning Academy ([Learning Path](https://www.ibm.com/training/learning-path/ibm-qradar-siem-foundation-694)). These notes cover IBM QRadar SIEM, a Security Information and Event Management platform for threat detection and response. I used **Grok**, created by xAI, to refine my notes for clarity and organization. Each chapter is in a separate Markdown file in the `docs/` folder.

This is a study resource for others and a portfolio project to show my QRadar knowledge.

## Courses Covered
My notes are based on these courses from the learning path:

1. **Introduction**: QRadarâ€™s role, event/flow collection, and threat detection.  
   [docs/01-introduction.md](docs/01-introduction.md)
2. **Architecture**: Event/flow processors, pipeline, and deployment models.  
   [docs/02-architecture.md](docs/02-architecture.md)
3. **Features**: Logs, flows, UBA, vulnerability management, and apps.  
   [docs/03-features.md](docs/03-features.md)
4. **User Management**: Roles, security profiles, domains, and authentication.  
   [docs/04-user-management.md](docs/04-user-management.md)
5. **Network Hierarchy**: IP range organization for monitoring and rules.  
   [docs/05-network-hierarchy.md](docs/05-network-hierarchy.md)
6. **Asset Management**: Asset profiles, reconciliation, and server discovery.  
   [docs/06-asset-management.md](docs/06-asset-management.md)
7. **Search and Analytics**: Quick Filters, AQL, and indexing for investigations.  
   [docs/07-search-analytics.md](docs/07-search-analytics.md)
8. **Log Sources and DSMs**: Protocols (Syslog, JDBC) and DSM parsing.  
   [docs/08-log-sources-dsms.md](docs/08-log-sources-dsms.md)
9. **Use Cases**: Threat detection, insider threats, compliance, and cloud security.  
   [docs/09-use-cases.md](docs/09-use-cases.md)
10. **Flows**: QRadar collects network activity information, or what is referred to as "flow records". 
   [docs/10-flows.md](docs/10-flows.md) 
11. **Offenses**: and its related subtopics (Data Retention and Data Obfuscation). 
   [docs/11-analyzing-offenses.md](docs/11-analyzing-offenses.md)

## Using Grok
I used **Grok** by xAI to:
- Fix typos and standardize terms.
- Organize notes into clear sections.
- Make the content professional and readable.

This helped me better understand QRadar and prepare for the certification.
